		To use Agent Based Models in Julia, there is already a package available called
			
			Agents.jl

		on which this course relies on.
		We will be covering some of the basics to use this package, but if you find
		yourself interested, I recommend checking out the official tuorial:
			https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/tutorial/
		
		This package should already be in your environment, but if not you can add
		it via the package manager.
		As always, you will start by loading this package into your environment:

			using Agents
