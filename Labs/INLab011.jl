		This is the last laboratory in this course, and it presents the assessed project for
		the course. In this laboratory, you will implement a program to demonstrate chaos in a
		gravitational system containing three bodies of equal mass in two dimensions. You will use
		Julia to analyse the execution of a complex simulation program, and adapt this program to
		use Runge-Kutta integration to (a) simulate 3-body motion and (b) evaluate its chaoticity.
		You will present your methods and results in two deliverables: Julia demonstration code and
		a poster (a single Powerpoint slide readable from the back of the room, containing title,
		author, text blocks, lines of code and diagrams).

		As an introduction to the topic, please view this video-clip now:
