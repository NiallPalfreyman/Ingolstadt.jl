		In this laboratory we look at a very important structure in Julia: arrays. Once you
		understand how arrays work, and how amazingly useful they are, you will (almost)
		never need to write a for-loop again!

		... But first we start with Ranges. A Range is an interval of values between start
		and stop boundaries. Here is a range of values between 1 and 5:

		r = 1:5

		What is the type of r?

		What is the type of this data structure?

	Activity(

		We can also construct ranges for other types, and we can also specify our own

		0.0:0.2:1.0

		values the range contains:

		collect() turns a Range into an Array. Arrays are the daily workhorse of a data
		scientist: they collect elements into tables of 1 or more dimensions. A 1-dimensional
		Array is called a Vector. Here is a COLUMN vector:

		What is its size()?

		As you can see, the FIRST dimension of an array runs down its columns, and
		the SECOND dimension runs across its rows.

		If you want to write a really super-duper-speedy program, you can create arrays
		using the values that are accidentally hanging around in memory:

		A = Array{Int}(undef,2,3)

		However, more usually we want to INITIALISE the elements of a new array. What

		A very powerful way of constructing arrays is by COMPREHENSION. That is, we
